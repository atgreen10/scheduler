 * @IDE Version: IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2.4 Community edition

 * @Purpose: This application keeps track of customer accounts and appointments with those customers as well as all information about the appointment such as time, location, type of appointment, who the appointment is with, etc.. The application is also able to generate a few different reports for the end user, including total customers by type and month, a schedule for each contact with appointment information, and my custom report on the data.
 
   @Driver Info:Java 11.0.9, JavaFX 11.0.2, MySQL 8.0.22

   @Directions:Once launched, the log in page will show onscreen. Enter user credentials and gain access to the main menu. On the main menu page there are 5 options to choose from. The first will show the user all appointments and their information and is accessed by selecting the button titled "Appointments." Here, the user is able to add new appointments to the calendar, update existing appointments, or remove appointments from the calendar. The next button on the main menu is titled "Customers" and will take the user to the page that contains all the customer information collected as well as allow the user to create new customers, update existing customers, and delete customers from the database. The next button is titled "Month/Type Report" and will take the user to a page to generate a report on the total number of appointments based on the month and type of appointment the user selects from the drop down menu options. The button titled "Schedule Report" will allow users to generate a report on all the appointments a specified contact has on the schedule. The contact that the schedule is generated for us determined by the drop down menu selection on the page. The button titled "#Appts/Contacts" will allow users to generate a total number of appointments that a selected contact has on the calendar by using the drop down menu to select one of the contacts listed from the database. The button titled "Exit" will quit the application.

   @Custom Report: The custom report I generated was to show the total number of appointments for a single contact that is selected using the drop down menu on the page.
